#  Medical Insurance Charges Prediction

This project contains following data and with the help of ML algorithms we need to 
predict the medical insurance charges for a person.  

#### Features in dataset

1.age: age of primary beneficiary

2.sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

3.bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or  low relative to height,

4.objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5  to 24.9

5.children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

6.smoker: Smoking

7.region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest,     northwest.

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (Target Column)
